You have two files: doc.txt and data.json. The git status
command shows that the two files are untracked and you realize
that you don't need them. Which command will remove the two files
from the current directory?

R: git clean -f

The difference between git clean and git rm lies in their purpose and usage:

    git clean: This command is used to remove untracked files from the working directory.
    Untracked files are those that Git is not currently managing.
    The -f flag is used to force the clean operation, ensuring that untracked files are removed.
    However, git clean will not remove files that are tracked or have been staged (added to the index) for commit.

    git rm: This command is used to remove files from the Git index and the working directory.
    It's typically used for files that are already tracked by Git.
    When you use git rm, you're telling Git to stop tracking the specified file and also remove it from the working directory.
    If you want to remove a file from both the index and the working directory, you would typically use git rm.
    Additionally, git rm can be used with various flags and options to handle different scenarios, such as removing files recursively or forcefully.
